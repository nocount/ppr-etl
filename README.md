# ppr-etl

This project is used to demonstrate a basic etl process using data from the Residential Property Price Registry as a programming assignment for Geowox. Scripts for extracting, transforming and loading are in the src directory.


Further Work:  
Scrape for ppr link instead of hardcoding it.  
Only fetch and process new data by scraping the other download page
Set up scripts to be run automatically periodically (Lambda, Kafka)  
Investigate further quarantining of data
